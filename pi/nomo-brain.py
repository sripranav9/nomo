              Interactive Media Capstone 2025  

Authors          : Liza Datsenko and Sri Pranav Srivatsavai
Capstone Advisor : Prof. Nimrah Syed
Last updated     : 17 April 2025
Description      : Nomo is an interactive desk companion robot built to 
                   encourage healthier work habits through computer 
                   vision, gesture recognition, and playful nudges.

Special thanks to Prof. Michael Shiloh and Prof. Aya Riad
for their valuable contributions.

* NOTES
- The Work mode is referred to as the Study mode in some cases of the code.
- To run this .py script and intiate the robot, run the flask app (info below).
