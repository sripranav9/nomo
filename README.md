# Nomo

**A Little Friend for a Big Focus**

Nomo is an interactive desk companion robot built to encourage healthier work habits through computer vision, gesture recognition, and playful nudges. Designed as a capstone project at NYU Abu Dhabi, Nomo blends real-time software with expressive hardware to promote mindful breaks and deep focus—making your workflow a little more human.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time gesture recognition (wave, closed fist, thumbs-up)
- LED feedback to guide breaks and focus sessions
- Raspberry Pi + Arduino integration
- Pettable with responsive purring vibration
- Location-based behavior (work and break zones)
- Designed with routines, attention, and well-being in mind


## 🚀 How It Works

Nomo runs on a Raspberry Pi using Python for vision and logic, paired with an Arduino for motor and sensor control. When placed in a predefined location, it can detect gestures and trigger break/focus states accordingly. Each mode is designed to reflect a balance between productivity and self-care.
